# Hey there, I'm Amir 👋

Welcome to my personal website!

I love connecting with people to learn and appreciate different perspectives. I
highly value humility, honesty, and originality. I am blessed with a supportive
wife and three amazing girls. I find joy in reading, cycling and weightlifting.

This space will offer an introduction to my expertise, projects and experiences.

## Leadership

I have twenty-five years of ICT industry experience working in multicultural
environments in Pakistan, Singapore, and Oman. Most of my professional life is
spent on managing teams and projects, interacting with clients and vendors and
delivering results. I have successfully delivered projects of up to 5 MUSD
value.

I believe that a leader’s real job is to invest time and energy in developing
healthy teams with a focus on personal growth. I am inspired by ideas of _Tom
DeMarco_ for developing thriving teams and of _W. Edwards Deming_ for developing
effective organizations.

Some of my favorite Deming quotes are:

> Any substantial improvement must come from action on the system, the
> responsibility of management. Wishing and pleading and begging the workers to
> do better was totally futile.
>
> A bad system will beat a good person every time.
>
> Quality is pride of workmanship.

## Programming

Notwithstanding the fact that I enjoy interacting with people and managing
project, I am a programmer at heart. Since my graduation in 1997 I have been
practicing and enjoying programming. If my job role does not require active
programming, I would look for opportunities for automation, scripting or
otherwise helping my team mates in technical tasks.

## AI / Machine Learning

When I joined academia in 2017 and started teaching undergrad students of
computer science, I got the chance to work in the area of AI / machine learning.
Since then I have kept my interest in the field by continuing to learn and
perform experimentation.
