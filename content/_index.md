Welcome to my personal website!

I am a person who loves engaging with people to appreciate different
perspectives and to keep learning and enjoying. I highly value originality,
humbleness and honesty. I am blessed with a supportive wife and three amazing
girls. I enjoy reding books, cycling and weight-lifting.

Here I will provide an introduction of my experience and expertise.

## Project Management

I have twenty-five years of ICT industry experience working in multicultural
environments in Pakistan, Singapore, and Oman. Most of my professional life is
spent on managing teams and projects, interacting with clients and vendors and
delivering results. The projects I worked on included large projects and up to 5
MUSD in value.

I have found that people can be motivated much better with proper focus and care
for their well being and growth. I have come to disagree with the carrot and
stick policy. Lately I have been influenced by people like Tom DeMarco and W.
Edwards Deming for developing effective teams and organizations.

## Programming

Notwithstanding the fact that I enjoy interacting with people and managing
project, I am a programmer at heart. Since my graduation in 1997 I have been
programming. If my job role does not require active programming, I would look
for opportunities for automation, scripting or otherwise helping my team mates
in technical tasks.

## Data Science and Machine Learning

When I joined academia in 2017 and started teaching undergrad students of
computer science, I got the chance to work in the area of Data Science and
Machine Learning.
