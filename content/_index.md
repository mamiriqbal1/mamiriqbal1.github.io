# Hey there, I'm Amir

[//]: ![Hey](/amir-iqbal-small.jpg)

Welcome to my personal website!

I am a person who loves engaging with people to appreciate different
perspectives and to keep learning and enjoying. I highly value originality,
humbleness and honesty. I am blessed with a supportive wife and three amazing
girls. I enjoy reding books, cycling and weight-lifting.

I have twenty-five years of ICT industry experience working in multicultural
environments in Pakistan, Singapore, and Oman. Most of my professional life is
spent on managing teams and projects, interacting with clients and vendors and
delivering results. The projects I worked on included large projects and up to 5
MUSD in value.

I have found that people can be motivated much better with proper focus and care
for their well being and growth. I have come to disagree with the carrot and
stick policy. Lately I have been influenced by people like Tom DeMarco and W.
Edwards Deming for developing effective teams and organizations.
