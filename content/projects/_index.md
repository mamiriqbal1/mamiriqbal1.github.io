Following is a list of some of my personal projects:

## Image Classification using Learning Classifier Systems

I created an image classifier (XCS-IMG) using evolutionary machine learning.
XCS-IMG is the adaptation of accuracy based learning classifier system (XCS) for
images. It is a step towards explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). I have
demonstrated how the evolved rules can be visualized to explain the
classification result. The system uses concept of filters that are evolved
during the learning phase to capture image features that can be visualized.

## Scraping Dynamic Websites using Puppeteer

As part of learning scraping, I have created a small project based on Puppeteer
that can scrape a website with continuous scrolling.
