I am a person who loves engaging with people to appreciate different
perspectives and to keep learning and enjoying. I highly value originality,
humbleness and honesty. I am blessed with a supportive wife and three amazing
girls. I enjoy reding books, cycling and weight-lifting.

I have twenty-five years of ICT industry experience working in multicultural
environments in Pakistan, Singapore, and Oman. Most of my professional life is
spent on managing teams and projects, interacting with clients and vendors and
delivering results. The projects I worked on included large projects and up to 5
MUSD in value.

I have found that people can be motivated much better with proper focus and care
for their well being and growth. I have come to disagree with the carrot and
stick policy. Lately I have been influenced by people like Tom DeMarco and W.
Edwards Deming for developing effective teams and organizations.

## Notable Projects

I will list two interesting projects that I worked on during my stay at Ericsson

### Telenor EasyPaisa Swap

Migration of Pakistan’s largest and the world’s 3rd largest Mobile Money system

### Mobilink Charging System Swap

Migration of the largest Ericsson Charging System Swap at the time Oman Mobile

## Last But Not The Least

Additionally, I have had the pleasure of teaching as Assistant Professor at
NU-FAST Lahore for four years. I am hands-on with Python and C++ and have done
work in the area of data science and machine learning.
