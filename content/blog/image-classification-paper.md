Image classification is one of the most important and much explored problem in
machine learning. Evolutionary computation techniques have been applied for
image classification for a lesser degree. Even where it is applied to images, it
is almost always applied to features pre-extracted from images and not directly
at the pixel level. This makes the decision about the kind of features to be
extracted a manual one. This paper presents a novel approach for image
classification using Learning Classifier Systems that does not require manually
designed features. This new technique known as RXCSi works directly on the image
pixels and evolves features required for given classification problem.
Experiments are performed on MNIST dataset and the initial results validate the
effectiveness of the technique for image classification. Another contribution of
the paper is that we demonstrate how the evolved features can be visualized to
understand basis for making a decision. We believe that RXCSi will open a new
direction of research for image classification using evolutionary techniques.
