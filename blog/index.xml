Evolutionary computation techniques have been applied for image classification for a lesser degree. Even where it is applied to images, it is almost always applied to features pre-extracted from images and not directly at the pixel level. This makes the decision about the kind of features to be extracted a manual one. This paper presents a novel approach for image classification using Learning Classifier Systems that does not require manually designed features.</description></item></channel></rss>
